### Feedback:
- Questrion 4: In part 1, ‘post.get("user”)[9:]’ will miss the posts in adults and teens files
- Question 5: You may want to compare the whole list instead of the top 50 result to get the correct answer.
- Question 6&7: Logic is right but code can not run since not all the variable names are changed properly.
