# US Domestic Flight Analysis

Data source is the U.S. DoT Bureau of Transportation Statistics:

As I have used Basemap module for doing a few analysis, you may have to download the module on your system.
You need to run with administrator rights "Anaconda Prompt" and in "Anaconda Prompt" run following command:

**conda install -c conda-forge basemap-data-hires=1.0.8.dev0**

, it will show new packages that you need to install and will ask you to install it - say 'Yes'.
After that new packages will be installed
