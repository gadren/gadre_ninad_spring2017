# US Domestic Flight Analysis

Data source is the U.S. DoT Bureau of Transportation Statistics:
http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time

As I have used Basemap module for doing a few analysis, you may have to download the module on your system.
You need to run with administrator rights "Anaconda Prompt" and in "Anaconda Prompt" run following command:

**conda install -c conda-forge basemap-data-hires=1.0.8.dev0**

, it will show new packages that you need to install and will ask you to install it - say 'Yes'.
After that new packages will be installed

Air travel in the United States has improved over the years with increase in the number of airports per state or with increase in the number of carriers or increase in the number of flights and various such things. Also, due to increase in air traffic, number of flight cancellations and delay have increased. By taking all these things into considerations, we will try and analyze the improvements in the US domestic air travel. We will also use the data from recent years, just to analyze various reasons behind flight delay and cancellations.
